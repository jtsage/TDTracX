This is the new version of TDTrac, completely refactored in CakePHP3 - it doesn't even almost
run correctly yet.

### Installation


## The Demo

If you want to run your own version of the demo, you can run the 'DemoReset' shell script. (This is totally destructive to the PRODUCTION database - you have been warned.)

To run it, you will need to be able to read and understand the php file, located at:

/src/Shell/DemoResetShell.php
